"The President is renewing MFN for China because he believes it advances critical U.S. interests at a time when China is at a critical turning point. Maintaining our overall relationship with China enables the U.S. to engage China in the months and years ahead, to enhance areas of cooperation and to pursue American interests in areas where we differ.  That engagement can help determine whether China becomes a destabilizing threat or a constructive force in Asia and in the world.  Substantial U.S. interests are at stake and renewal of MFN best advances those interests. Revoking MFN would raise average tariffs on Chinese imports from 5% to 45%. It would effectively sever our economic relationship with China, undermining our capacity to influence China in a broad range of areas, including human rights, nonproliferation, trade , Taiwan relations and others.  It is a clumsy and counterproductive instrument that would set us down the wrong path. It would reverse three decades of bipartisan China policy and would seriously weaken our influence not only in China, but throughout Asia.
