It is the view of this Senator that that would be a mistake; that the efforts to have a partial MFN linkage or impose  partial trade sanctions  against China, or the efforts to have a code of conduct for American businesses, would get us basically in the same soup we are in right now. So I would urge the administration not to do that, and to take the very simple position that continued linkage of MFN and human rights is not in the best interests of the United States.
