I am going to give you 45 metaphors, all of which have trade as their central theme. Your goal is to detect if there is 
a marking device in the metaphor or not.

Marking devices are used to mark the source domain. For instance, using  “as” to mark the source domain LEVERAGE: “...the
previous administration was unwilling to use our huge trade deficit with China as leverage...”  or using ‘as’ to mark 
imaginary enemies and IMAGINARY ENEMIES : “The U.S. regarded trade partners as imaginary enemies .”

Here is a list of marking devices:
modal verb+be (“might be,” “should be,” “could be,” “would be,” “can be,” etc.)
If it contains a dash sign (—) (Look specificaly if it marks the source domain)
¨including¨
¨form¨
¨just¨
¨become¨
¨remain¨
¨define¨
¨a little¨
¨almost¨
¨called¨
¨has/have/had been¨
¨something or other¨
¨as¨
¨literally¨
¨to use an analogy¨
¨like¨
‘:’ (Look specificaly if it marks the source domain)
¨mean¨
¨feel like¨
¨serve as¨
¨represent¨
¨sort of¨
¨kind of¨
¨really¨
‘imagine´
´so to speak’
¨actually¨
¨if you like¨
 ‘in a way¨
‘as it were¨

Obviously, there are more marking devices than those provided in the list. If you see potential marking devices with the same 
function as those on the list that are not included, you can treat them as marking devices as well. These types are:
1) Function words that perform a grammatical role but don´t carry much meaning themselves (¨including¨, ¨as¨, ¨like¨).
2) Hedges that make phrases less direct or certain (¨a little¨, ¨kind of¨, ¨almost¨).
3) Metadiscourse reflecting on the language or structure of the text itself (¨to use an analogy¨, ¨imagine¨, ¨feel like¨).

Be careful with colons and dashes as they don't always introduce source domains. In that case, check to see if a noun immediately 
follows one of these two signs, as this could potentially be a source domain.

Please keep in mind that everything is a metaphor. Despite what you might think, they are all figurative, not literal. So please don´t 
rule out emphasis, even if you think they are not metaphorical.

So, if there are marking devices, I want you to classify the metaphor as marking. If you cannot identify any marking devices, 
then classify it as no marking.

Metaphor 1: Is there a marking device in the metaphor 'Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson: "The signing of the Phase One Trade Agreement with China is a welcomed beginning to resolve these trade disputes, and serves as a symbol of the patriotism of our farmers.  I'm grateful for the work President Trump is doing on behalf of agriculture and trade .'?
Metaphor 2: Is there a marking device in the metaphor 'China is  part of the next generation of Asian trade for the United States.'?
Metaphor 3: Is there a marking device in the metaphor 'As I see it, the first year of the Bush administration, we had about  a $3 million trade deficit   with China.'?
etc.
