I am going to give you 50 metaphors, all of which have trade as their central theme. Your goal is to detect if there is a repetition in the metaphor or not.

Repetition: Repetition of the same verb with the same source domain. In this example, the cue is repeating ’stole’ within the source domain of 
CRIME: “...other countries stole our factories, stole our plants, stole our wealth, and stole our jobs.”

Repetition is also counted if the lexeme of the verb is the same, but the form is different, for example, ´sing´ and ´sung´. Converting the verb into a noun 
within the same sentence (e.g. ´sing´ and ´song´) is also allowed.

Please keep in mind that everything is a metaphor. Despite what you might think, they are all figurative, not literal. So please don´t rule out verb 
repetitions, even if you think they are not metaphorical.

So, if there is repetition, I want you to classify the metaphor as such. If you cannot identify any repetition, then classify it as no repetition.

Metaphor 1: Is there repetition in the metaphor 'On trade , I've kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster.'?
Metaphor 2: Is there repetition in the metaphor 'This is the first time  Section 201 of the Trade Act  has been used to impose tariffs in 16 years.'?
Metaphor 3: Is there repetition in the metaphor 'THE PRESIDENT: So, I can tell you this: China would much rather make  a trade deal  than I would.'?
etc.
