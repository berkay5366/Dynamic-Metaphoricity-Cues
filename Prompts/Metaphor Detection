Metaphor type
-------------------------
1) Indirect metaphor
The bulk of metaphor-related lexical units in this corpus are indirect metaphors. For indirect metaphors, there is a contrast as well as comparison between the contextual and a more basic meaning.

The contextual meaning may be conventionalized and will thus be found in a general users’ dictionary. It may also be novel or specialized and will thus not be found in a general users’ dictionary.

The basic meaning is a more concrete, specific or human-related sense. Basic meanings can be found in general users’ dictionaries.

Example:

Professional religious education teachers like Marjorie B Clark (Points of View, today) are doing valuable work in many secondary schools (...). (K58-fragment01)

Valuable is used indirectly in this context because it evokes a referent (‘very useful and important’) that is different from the basic - direct - meaning of valuable (‘worth a lot of money’). Metaphorical meaning arises through non-literal comparison between the contextual and the basic meaning.

valuable
adjective
1) worth a lot of money -> basic meaning (¨The necklace is not very valuable a valuable antique¨) 
2) very useful and important -> contextual meaning (¨The job gave her an opportunity to gain valuable experience.¨)
valuable insights/lessons/information: The research should provide valuable insights into organizational arrangements.
a valuable contribution/resource/addition: Her latest book is a valuable contribution to the debate of cloning.
prove valuable: The results could prove extremely valuable.
a.   valuable time is important because there is not much of it available valuable seconds were wasted while Schumacher’s car was stuck in the pits.
-------------------------
2) Direct metaphor
There is no contrast between the contextual and a more basic meaning. The contextual meaning is also the basic meaning. The comparison is expressed through direct language use. The direct language use may or may not be signaled.

Example with metaphor signal:
(...) he’s like a ferret. (KBD-fragment21)

Ferret is a direct metaphor. Its contextual meaning, ‘a small thin furry animal with a long tail that people use for hunting rabbits and rats,’ is also its basic meaning. The comparison is expressed by direct language use. The direct language use is signaled by like.

ferret
noun
a small thin furry animal with a long tail that people use for hunting rabbits and rats -> basic meaning & contextual meaning

Example without metaphor signal:

(...) They [system developers] seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get an answer that amounts to a draft system specification. A doctor doesn’t ask his patient what treatment to prescribe. The patient can explain only what the problem is. It is the doctor that provides the remedy. A user may have a deep knowledge of business problems, but knowing little about computers, has no idea how they should be tackled. (...) (A8R-fragment02)

The lexical units in blue have been marked as direct metaphor. Their direct metaphorical use is not signaled. Nevertheless, there is a comparison between two different domains (medical and systems development).
-------------------------
3) Implicit metaphor
Implicit metaphor is due to an underlying cohesive grammatical and/or semantic link in the discourse which points to recoverable metaphorical material.

Example:
Naturally, to embark on such as step is not necessarily to succeed in realizing it. (A9J-fragment01)

In principle, it does not call for a non-literal indirect or direct comparison. Note, however, that it refers back to the metaphorically used lexical unit step. Since an analysis of the discourse would need to show step instead of it, it becomes implicitly metaphorical. (Naturally, to embark on such as step is not necessarily to succeed in realizing the step.)
-------------------------
Sentence 1: Does the following sentence contain a metaphor (indirect, direct, implicit) 'After the trade deal was enacted–I am talking about  President Trump's trade deal –I kept speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party, calling attention to their human rights abuses, their military buildup, their manipulative trade tactics, and their economic bullying.'?
Sentence 2: Does the following sentence contain a metaphor (indirect, direct, implicit) 'Q Mr. President, we're hearing rumblings from China that they're not really positive about a trade deal  and that perhaps (inaudible) may not happen.'?
Sentence 3: Does the following sentence contain a metaphor (indirect, direct, implicit) 'And as we speak, I'm pleased to report the United States is working very closely with Canada and Mexico to modernize  the North American Free Trade Agreement .'?
etc...
